- **Editing**: Enables users to edit the extracted text directly within the app.
- **Export**: Allows users to save the extracted text as a text file and share it with others.
- **History**: Provides a history feature to view past text extraction entries with sharing and deletion options.
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: Designed with an intuitive UI for effortless text extraction and management.
